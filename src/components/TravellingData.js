        note: "The Grand Teton National Park is absoblutely stunning. The beauty of the park and the majestic grand tetons took my breath away everytime I visited the park. Staring at the rocky mountains always allured my curiosity and feeling of having stood at the top the highiest one. I would never get tired of looking at the rookies, the lake and everything about this park. I am sure that I will come back to this park time after time in the future. I love the Grand Teton National Park."

        date: "September - October, 2022",
        note: "The National Manument Valley is a strange and slightly scary place for me because of its geologic heritage. The red rocks are standing tall in the middle of desert like temples. Besides seeing the nature wonders, I have met some amazing native americans during my last visit. I learned some of their cultures and history. I will never forget my experience about the place and the people of this part of the country."

        date: "September - October, 2022",
        note: "The grandfather of all national parks around the world, Yellow Stone National Park, is the richest one in nature beauty wealth. This cayon fall is one of the most spectacular nature beauties. Standing at the top of this high waterfall made me feel like I am in another planet. Looking down to the base of this waterfall from the top was somewhat intimidating, but it was also very satisfying."

        date: "September - October, 2022",
        note: "Dinosaur National Manument is a must visit place if you love nature just like I do. You have to drive through a narrow path surrounded by the cliffs on both left and right to get to this place. One of my friends, who I was travelling with, creamed out of his panic attack while we were driving through. There are beautiful nature at every point in this park."
