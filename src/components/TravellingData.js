        note: "The Grand Teton National Park is absoblutely stunning. The beauty of the park and the majestic grand tetons take my breath away everytime I visit the park. They say that there are many wild lives such as moose, elks, goats, bear and many more. But, I am just overwhemed with the beauty of the park itself. I would get out of my car, stare at the rocky mountains and think what the feeling would be to stand at the top the highiest one. I would never get tired of looking at the rookies, the lake and everything about this park. I love the Grand Teton National Park."

        note: "The grandfather of all national parks around the world, Yellow Stone National Park, is the richest one in nature beauty wealth. This cayon fall is one of the most spectacular nature beauties. Standing at the top of this high waterfall made me feel like I am in another planet. Looking down to the base of this waterfall from the top was somewhat intimidating, but it was also very satisfying."

        note: "Dinosaur National Manument is a must visit place if you love nature just like I do. You have to drive through a narrow path surrounded by the cliffs on both left and right to get to this place. One of my friends, who I was travelling with, creamed out of his panic attack while we were driving through. There are beautiful nature at every point in this park."
